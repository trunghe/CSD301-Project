We can calculate matrix $B$ of size $(n - a + 1) \\times (m - b + 1)$ where $B[i][j]$ is the cost to use rectangle $a \\times b$ with upper left corner $(i, j)$.\n",

    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1, n - a + 1):\n",
    "    for j in range(1, m - b + 1):\n",

    "        B[i][j] -= minVal * a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Find the minimum unchosen element of $B$ with the smallest $i$ (row index). If there are more than one such minimums, choose the element with the smallest $j$ (column index). If the rectangle size $a \\times b$ with upper left corner $(i, j)$ does not overlap with any existing answer then add it to the set of answers. Mark $B[i][j]$ as chosen (use a boolean matrix $done$ and set $done[i][j] = $ true. Repeat until all elements of $B$ have been chosen.\n",

    "Complexity estimation of simple brute force approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Each rectangle has size $a \\times b$, so calculating the sum for each rectangle takes $a \\times b$ iterations. There are $(n - a + 1) \\times (m - b + 1)$ such rectangles in matrix $A$, so the number of iterations is\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a \\times b \\times (n - a + 1) \\times (m - b + 1) $\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So the time complexity of Step 1 is quite similar to Step 2. We can say that the time complexity for the entire simple brute force solution is $O((n \\times m)^2)$.\n",

    "The maximum allowance for the entire solution is $1\\times10^{8}$ so we need to find a faster approach.\n",

    "### Idea 2: Dynamic Programming (Step 1) and Greedy (Step 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 could be improved with a simple dynamic programming. We will create matrix $C$ where $C[i][j]$ is the cost of the rectangle with upper left corner $(1, 1)$ and lower right corner $(i, j)$. We will use row $0$ and column $0$ here for simplicity of code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can use $C$ to calculate $B$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1, n - a + 1):\n",
    "    for j in range(1, m - b + 1):\n",
    "        B[i][j] = C[i+a-1][j+b-1] - C[i+a-1][j-1] - C[i-1][j+b-1] + C[i-1][j-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using descending values for iterations $i$ and $j$ can simply the indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in rangeDown(n - a + 1, 1):\n",
    "    for j in rangeDown(m - b + 1, 1):\n",
    "        B[i][j] = C[i][j] - C[i-a][j] - C[i][j-b] + C[i-a][j-b]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of iterations to calculate $C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ n + m + n \\times m $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ = O(n \\times m) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of iterations to calculate $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (n - a + 1) \\times (m - b + 1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ = O(n \\times m) $\n",
    "\n",
    "So this DP version of Step 1 takes at most $n \\times m \\approx 10^6$ iterations which is well within the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have only done calculating the sum of each rectangle $a \\times b$. Now we have to find the smallest value in each rectangle to calculate the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $M$ be the matrix size $(n - a + 1) \\times (m - b + 1)$ where $M[i][j]$ is the minimum element in the $a \\times b$ rectangle with upper left corner $(i, j)$. Then we simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1, n - a + 1):\n",
    "    for j in range(1, m - b + 1):\n",
    "        B[i][j] -= M[i][j] * a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate M, the next dynamic programming approach we will use is the sliding window technique. With this technique, we can find the minimum value of a equal-sized sub-matrix by re-using the information of the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the DP approach, let's consider the 1-dimensional case. Given a list $L$ of length $n$, a positive integer $k$ where $k$ is less than or equal to $n$, the start index $i$ and the value of that element $v$, we will create a procedure that returns the minimum value of each window of length $k$. Let this procedure be <code>PROCEDURE Min1DWindow(L, n, k, i, v)</code>. To store the minimums, let $F$ be a list of length $n - k + 1$ where $F[i]$ is the min value of the $k$-window from $i$. To calculate the matrix M, we will apply this procedure as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1, n - a + 1):\n",
    "    L = GetRow(i, A)\n",
    "    for j in range(1, m - b + 1):\n",
    "        M[i][j] = Min1DWindow(L, m, b, j, A[i][j])\n",
    "        \n",
    "for j in range(1, m - b + 1):\n",
    "    L = GetCol(j, M)\n",
    "    for i in range(1, n - a + 1):\n",
    "        M[i][j] = Min1DWindow(L, n, a, i, M[i][j])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where <code>GetRow(i, A)</code> returns the $i$-th row of matrix $A$ as a list and <code>GetCol(i, A)</code> returns the $i$-th column as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the complexity of calculating $M$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (n - a + 1) \\times (m - b + 1) \\times 2 \\times t $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ = O(n \\times m \\times t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is the runtime complexity of <code>Min1DWindow</code>. Since $n \\times m$ could get up to $10^6$, we need to keep the complexity of <code>Min1DWindow</code> small.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's see the naive approach for minimum 1D window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PROCEDURE Min1DWindowNaive(L, n, k, i, v):\n",
    "    minVal = INF\n",
    "    for j in range(i, i + k):\n",
    "        minVal = min(minVal, L[j])\n",
    "    return minVal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of iterations this naive 1D window minimum algorithm will take is $k$, which is $a$ for rows or $b$ for columns. Using this over a list will lead to quadratic runtime. Combining this into the algorithm to calculate matrix $M$ will lead to cubic runtime, which is too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sliding window for 1 dimension for window starting from index $i$ length $k$ uses a double-ended queue $Q$ that stores pairs of integers. Each pair $(i, v)$ represents the index of the element in the array in consideration and the value of that element. The pseudocode is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PROCEDURE Min1DWindowDP(Q, n, k, i, v):\n",
    "    if Q.size > 0 and Q.front.i == i:\n",
    "        Q.pop_front()\n",
    "    while Q.size > 0 and Q.back.v > v:\n",
    "        Q.pop_back()\n",
    "    Q.push_back([i, v])\n",
    "    return Q.front.v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each element is pushed into or popped out of the double-ended queue at most once, the number of iterations this 1D sliding window algorithm takes is $O(n)$. Using this over the whole array will lead to a runtime of $O(n)$ and combining into calculating $M$ will be $O(n^2)$.\n",
    " \n",
    "Step 2: Convert the information of $B$ into a list of 3-tuples $(c, i, j)$ where $c$ is the cost value and $i, j$ are the indices and the upper left corner in $O(n \\times m)$ iterations. Sort this list (first by $c$, then by $i$ and finally by $j$) in $O(n \\times m \\times \\log(n \\times m))$ iterations. Then we perform an in-order traversal, also in $O(n \\times m \\times \\log(n \\times m))$ iterations. Finally, traverse through the list and only add the current element to the set of answers if each of its 4 corners does not lie within any rectangle in the current set of answers (again use a boolean matrix $done$, if $done[i][j] = true$ then $(i, j)$ lies within some existing rectangle). If it is chosen, mark all of the indices of the elements within the rectangle as done ($done[x][y] = $ true $\\forall x, y$ such that $i <= x <= i + a - 1$ and $j <= y <= j + b - 1$. Since each index pair $(i, j)$ can only be set to true once, the complexity is only $O(n \\times m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this Greedy version of Step 2 takes at most $n \\times m \\times \\log(n \\times m) \\approx 2 \\times 10^7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the time complexity of Step 2 is greater than Step 1, it will be used as the time complexity of the whole solution. So this DP and Greedy version will pass the time limit with time complexity $O(n \\times m \\times \\log(n \\times m))$.\n",
